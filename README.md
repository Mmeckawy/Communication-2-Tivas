# Communication between 2 tiva c microcontrollers
## Application using UART
When the switch 1 in the first tiva is pressed, the second tiva red led is turned on, and when switch 2 in the second tiva is pressed the blue light is turned on in the first tiva giving us a full duplex communication between the two devices.
## User guide
1) You should run each file in a different project
2) Flash each project on a different tiva
3) Do the wire connection and the application should work
